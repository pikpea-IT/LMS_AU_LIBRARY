                                    were three
                                    established universities including Ta Prohm University (taught literature, arts,
                                    philosophy and
                                    religion), Preah Khan University (taught management and general knowledge) and Neak

                                    (taught medical treatments) in Siem Reap (until 16th century, known as
                                    Yasodharapura). They were
                                    considered as the Union of Angkor Universities. Before the year of 2002, there were
                                    few high schools
                                    and technical centers in Siem Reap city. Only foreign languages and basic pedagogy
                                    were taught. The
                                    initiative for the establishment of the university, is attributed to H.E. Neak Oknha
